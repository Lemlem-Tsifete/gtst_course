# Introduction to Cyber Security

Cybersecurity a very wide field in the IT/information Technology/world 

***Cyber** relating to computer culture (such as the internet, virtual reality, etc. ) and computer network*

it is the practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks 

These cyber-attacks are usually aimed at accessing , changing or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via ransomware or interrupting normal business processes 
Those Cyber attacks are called "Hacking"

**Hacking** is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities 

Types of Hackers based on **Ethics**
1 Black Hat hackers
- The most evil and bad peoples in the cyberspaces
2  white Hat hackers
 - The helping and good Peoples
3 Gray Hat hackers
  - individuals who sometimes act ethically and other times engage in questionable 
  
## Types of hackers based on skill

1 Newbie / Noob
 - Don't have any knowledge about hacking
 2 Script kiddie or skid
 - have some clue about Hacking but they don't know the detail of the hacking 
3 Hacker
- perfectly skilled, with less experience 
 4 Elite / pro Hacker
-  perfectly skilled, with much more experience 

Element of Information Security 

**CIA triad
 c : Confidentiality  ምስጢራዎነት
  I ፡ Integrity  ታማኝነት
  A : Availability ተገኝነት

**Phases of Hacking**
- Reconnaissance (search the information where to get the things )
- scanning (find the weakness for the thing Identifying open ports, services and vulnerabilities)
- Gaining Access (Exploiting vulnerabilities to access get)
- Maintaining Access (establishing backdoors or persistence for continuous access)
- Clearing Tracks of Logs (Erasing logos and hiding any signs )

**Penetration Testing** 
is a methos of evaluation 
- find vulnerability
- security measures : defining key performance indicators(KPI) like incident rates, response times and compliance using tools like SIEMs/EDRs, conducting audits/assessments
- Documentation and Report Preparation

Types of pen testing

 *Black box pen testing
- Testing system without prior knowledge 
- you test as an attacker
 *White Box Pen testing
  - Testing system with prior knowledge
  - you test as developer 
 *Gray Box pen testing*
  - testing system with limitied knowledge
  
*Cyber security field terms
Red Teaming/offensive security
Blue Teaming/defensive security
security Audit
vulnerability assessment *
